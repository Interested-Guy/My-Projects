This is an online certification course that I had taken in my first year from NPTEL (an MOOC initiative of the Government Of India coordinated
by IITs and other premier institutions). 

The name of this course is **Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using python**.

This 8 week course is an excellent course on Python which teaches several important concepts like Time Complexity, User Defined Lists
Dynamic Programming etc.

This course provides weekly assignments of moderate level which have to be completed mandatorily as part of obtaining the certification. 

Besides, we also had a programming exam and an offline(Computer based) exam. All these ensure that a serious learner always gets the best 
knowledge and learning experience both theoretically and practically.

I have provided few programs which were a part of this course and a gist of the course in the form of a html file(html file to be downloaded with folder 'Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using python'(provided in this directory). Then open the file to view the contents.)
