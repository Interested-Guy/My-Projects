Data Analytics With Python is an NPTEL Course made by IIT Roorkee. An excellent course by Ramesh Anbanandam Sir who teaches 
topics like p value, anova, regression with ease. 

It not only provides a solid theoretical foundation but also good programming skills. 

Every Jupyter notebook in the folder has been prepared by me as I went with the course flow. The course is still going on and I am working 
to add more notebooks.. I have also provided the .csv files required for the notebooks.
