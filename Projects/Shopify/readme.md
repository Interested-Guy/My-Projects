Shopify had a challenge which was compulsory to undertake while trying to apply for their internship.

This challenge has two parts:One was a Shopping dataset while the other was an SQL problem.

Here is the problem statement:

Question 1 : On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. 
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, 
we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, 
something seems wrong with our analysis.

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?
(I have put the dataset in this directory).

Question 2 : For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. 
Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

The notebook contains my response to the problem.
