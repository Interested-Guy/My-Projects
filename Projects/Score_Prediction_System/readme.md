The Score Prediction System is a Djamgo web-app which uses linear regression to predict the score of a student, based on the no. of hours he/she studies.
For our simplicity we consider a number between 0 and 10. 

The web app accepts an input and processes the input if and only if it is an integer from 0 to 10(included). If an invalid input is given it displays an 
appropriate error message. Otherwise it returns a number which is the marks predicted for the given no. of hours.

The web app has been deployed on PythonAnywhere.
